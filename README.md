This is a project in support of my university module 'Digital Humanities'

This program scrapes, analyzes and visualizes data collected from the
video game 'World of Warcraft'

The data contain auction house data (an ingame trading system like ebay) 
and player data collected like a census, containing the amount of players, 
player classes/races, level and zones they play in

The data will be analyzed to determine the best selling items, players with
the most trading activity, game zones with the least players, class and race
distribution and much more
